                                <p>Sometimes we're asked &quot;What's different about FindMe, a Personal Rescue Beacon
                                that protects people from the dangers of hypothermia, heat stroke, hard falls,
                                getting lost, and traffic and water risk, compared to generic GPS/geofence trackers
                                on the market right now?&quot;</p>
                                <p>This question is usually posed an individual who has just started to experience the
                                mixed blessings of being a caregiver.</p>
                                <p>So, to explain why generic IoT wearable solutions are often incompatible with the
                                needs of people living with dementia, and their caregivers, it's important to
                                review important facts about individuals living with Alzheimer's:</p>
                                <p>First, the person living with Alzheimer's (depending on the stage they are in):</p>
                                <ul class="custom-list-style">
                                    <li><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i>Does not have a reliable short-term memory.
                                    </li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i>This means that if you give them a new
                                        device that requires them to operate it, they probably won't be able
                                        to. They may likely not recognize it, even if taken from their own pocket
                                        or purse (ie. A help button or walkie-talkie feature may go unused).</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    say they will embark on a particular direction away from their home, and
                                    sometimes just keep going.</li>
                                    <li><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i>May want to remained undiscovered (hide) when
                                    they wander</li>
                                    <li><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i>Will likely remove a new piece of jewelry (a
                                    GPS amulet or a wristwatch) by the end of the day (they will have no idea
                                    who it belongs to—only that it is not theirs—or that it's unattractive, or
                                    "medical" looking that makes them feel ashamed and stigmatized).</li>
                                    <li><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i>May chafe repeatedly at a locked-on piece of
                                    jewelry. (One case study noted a caregiver explaining that her uncle would
                                    try to chew a wrist-worn device off)</li>
                                    <li><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i>May spend much of their time indoors, sometimes
                                    in rooms without windows like bathrooms</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Wandering alone is not necessarily dangerous, but what happens during a wandering
                                event can be—hypothermia, heat stroke, traffic accidents, and drowning are the
                                most common causes of serious injury and death from wandering.</p>
                                <p>Wandering can be done in the front yard—aimlessly going back and forth, and deadly
                                if it's snowing outside, or a very hot summer day from dehydration.</p>
                                <p>So, with this in mind, consider the generic GPS/geofence solutions, which are not
                                built for people living with dementia or their caregivers, and see how they work.</p>
                                <h3>The Generic  Tracker:</h3>
                                <p>This has a built-in modem, a gps chip, and let's you set a timer on how often it
                                will ping your cell phone. It also uses a standard GSM modem, and a 2G network.</p>
                                <p><strong>Wearability</strong>:</p>
                                <p><em>If it's worn around the  neck, like an amulet.</em>
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>Results</strong>: Often, it's taken off by the end of the day. If the caregiver
                                rebukes the person living with Alzheimer's for taking off the amulet, that person
                                will generally have no idea what the caregiver is talking about. On a case by
                                case basis, for some individuals who have a well worn habit of wearing a necklace,
                                and who don't reject an unfamiliar one, an amulet may work. To test for this,
                                buy a plain plastic amulet at the store for $3, which weighs about 50g, and see
                                if your loved one is wearing it at the end of the week. Careful observation will
                                be needed.</p>
                                <p><em>It's worn on the wrist,  like a wristwatch.</em>
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>Results</strong>: Generally, it's taken off by the end of the day, and put
                                away somewhere, unless it's locked on. The person living with Alzheimer's will
                                experience the watch as an oddity, and remove it (just like you would if you
                                suddenly found some else's watch on your wrist). If locked on, it may cause chafing
                                and fixation, and consequently damage the paper-thin skin that some seniors have.
                                Also, unless it's presented with pleasing aesthetics, studies by the AARP have
                                found that it will be felt as stigmatizing and cause resentment. Like the amulet,
                                it's a case by case situation, requiring careful observation over a period of
                                time. </p>
                                <p>Just like the amulet, test it out. Buy a $3, bulky knock-off watch and place it on
                                them, and check to see if they are wearing it at the end of a week.</p>
                                <p>Basically and importantly, new wearables that are intrusive will be abandoned.</p>
                                <h3>Our Solution:</h3>
                                <p>We visited over 30 Assisted Care and Memory Care units, interviewed the staff nurses,
                                the caregivers, and the executive directors of the facilities, as well as directors
                                of group homes and caregivers who were the adult children of parents with Alzheimer's,
                                and the Medical doctors at Banners Alzheimer's Institute (because we're caregivers
                                ourselves).</p>
                                <p>We learned that for those residents that had carried keys with them through their
                                adult life continued to carry their keys wherever they went, and were careful
                                not to leave their home without their keys. </p>
                                <p><strong>It was a life long habit.</strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>By observation, this life-long habits of carrying keys remained until the later part
                                of mid-stage dementia.</p>
                                <p>Therefore, we designed FindMe to be an unobtrusive key fob, which attached to the
                                key ring that person living with Alzheimer's typical used. We observed that changing
                                the nature of the key ring, such as the use of a simple, plastic covered coil
                                in many residential care facilities, had no effect on whether the residents always
                                carrying their keys with them.</p>
                                <p>Our answer was to build on long-term habits that required no new learning, and no
                                foreign intrusions.</p>
                                <p>Thus, at the end of the day, if your generic tracker is either an amulet or a wristwatch,
                                it may be removed, and careful observation over time is best. And, this is why
                                we designed FindMe as a key fob, for use by individuals who have carried keys
                                for their adult life.</p>
