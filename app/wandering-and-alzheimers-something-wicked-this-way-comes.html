                        <h2>Wandering and Alzheimer's: Something Wicked this way Comes</h2>
                        <h3>Wandering is complicated. </h3>
                        <p>For example, Milo was staying at a  Brookdale Assisted Care facility, Horizon Bay, in Chandler Arizona.  He'd been diagnosed with vascular dementia.  One day, Milo, who often went for short walks in the neighborhood of the  facility, crossed the street where the Chandler Regional Hospital was, went  into the emergency care wing, and asked to see a doctor about his memory  problems.</p>
                        <p>Instead of treating Milo, or  instead of walking him home (across the street), the hospital called the  Brookdale corporate offices in Minnesota and lodged a complaint that Brookdale  was not properly looking after its residents.</p>
                        <p>Brookdale's corporate office  called Horizon Bay and ordered that Milo be evicted the next day, because he  was seen as a wandering risk. </p>
                        <p>So, Wandering is <em>quite</em> <em>complicated</em>. Not only does it have safety components, but it also  has legal and housing components.</p>
                        <p>The employees at Milo's assisted  care facility argued with Corporate that Milo was not a wandering risk; he  simply went for walks. They explained that he comported himself safely at all  times: looked both ways before crossing the street, walked in crosswalks, and  never started off in a given direction to only just keep going. </p>
                        <p>Horizon Bay's employees argued to  Corporate that what Milo was doing was <em>not  wandering, </em>But, they lost the argument with Brookdale Corporate, and Milo  was evicted.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p><a href="img/blog/signs_of_wandering.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/blog/signs_of_wandering.png" alt="Warning Signs of Wandering" class="img-responsive" title="Warning Signs of Wandering" style="border: thin #ccc solid"/></a></p>
                        <h3>What is Wandering?</h3>
                        <p>Ordinarily, wandering is  associated with individuals, who are living with Alzheimer's, taking off in  some undetermined direction, and continuing until they're either found--or  not.  As an illustration, long time Cape  Cod reporter, <a href="http://bys.care/1DOXb7b" title="Living with Alzheimer's - A Place Called Pluto" target="_blank">Greg O'Brien</a> explained about his own case of early onset  Alzheimer's, "Sometimes when I am in my boat I want to head out to sea and just  keep going."</p>
                        <p>But, from the Assisted Care  community viewpoint, wandering can be any behavior that leads to a person  leaving the property unescorted—leading to eviction and to deep family  frustration and sometimes despair (see, for example, <a href="http://bys.care/1zHxswH" title="Diana Hull: Alzheimer's care in Santa Cruz lacking">this piece written by  Diana Hull</a> about her experiences finding assisted care for her mother in Santa  Cruz).  It's  frequently cause for automatic eviction, because of the legal liability it  creates (however, memory care units, locked down, are usually available for an additional $1,500/mo.)</p>
                        <p>In other instances, understanding wandering is more nuanced, distinguished by its motivation.  As one executive director of a high-end facility explained,                          &quot;Wandering is driven by the need or desire to 'be free' and to 'escape.'&quot; This is different from the desire to take a walk, get some fresh air--but with a likelihood of becoming lost--and, for example, asking for directions to get back to where one might be staying. While both would be a cause for assisted care eviction, only the former would actually be &quot;wandering.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Importantly, in some quarters,  there's a <a href="http://bys.care/1v7lYyz" title="Myth Busting: The Wandering Issue" target="_blank">concerted effort</a> to re-state wandering as simply "walking," and to  de-stigmatize the behavior and explain that it's a healthy outlet for a variety  of pent-up emotions and feelings that have the frustrations of memory loss and  confusion as their motivating source. <a href="http://bys.care/1v7lYyz"></a></p>
                        <p>With all that said, however,  wandering can be absolutely dangerous. Three out of every five persons  diagnosed with Alzheimer's will wander, and if they are not found within 24  hours they have a 50% chance of serious injury of worse.</p>
                        <h3>The Cure may be worse than the Illness</h3>
                        <p>Family caregivers face tremendous pressures and responsibilities for guarding the physical safety of their loved ones with Alzheimer's. Legal pressures to put loved ones with Alzheimer's in memory care are intense; lawsuits are always lurking around the corner. For examples,  some law firms specialize in the <a href="http://bys.care/1DoI8Dj" title="Stebner and Associates Law Firm" target="_blank">wandering related litigation</a>  and place on their website  the aggressive position that "Implementing a plan that involves putting that  family member in a locked room…may be an important first step." </p>
                        <p>But this leaves families caught  between a rock and a hard place, assailed from all sides. The financial and  emotional pressures of family caregiving, to preserve their loved one's  freedoms, are formidable.  The fact is  that moving their loved one to even the best Memory Care unit will result in an  acceleration of their decline, and leave them in the equivalent of a minimum  security prison, but with nicer gardens and guards.  While Memory Care units claim that their  residents "don't notice" that they're in lock-down, Maja Daniel's photo/audio  essay, <a href="http://bys.care/1ySh3D7" title="Into Oblivion" target="_blank">Into Oblivion</a>, exposes that myth when she shows  the scarring on the door of a memory care unit where the residents spend the  better part of each day trying to break the lock that holds them in.</p>
                        <h3><strong>Because unchecked power over the vulnerable can breed bad  outcomes</strong></h3>
                        <p>In Milo's case, the Brookdale facility offered that Milo stay for a month in their lock-down unit, until his family had a chance to find preferred accommodations. On the 7th  day of his stay, he called his family to report that an employee at the  temporary facility had tried to sexually exploit him. and Milo urged to leave  immediately, which with the help of his family he did. The facility did not  conduct a follow up investigation, but only commented that "Residents say  things all the time to get attention."</p>
                        <p>But not all Memory Care units are  nightmarish. A tour of the Fountain View Village in Fountain Hills, Arizona, is  filled with residents exuding serenity and well-being; however, even there,  when asked about the keypad next to the fourth floor elevator where the Memory  Care unit was located, the Executive Director admitted that some living there  do try to "escape" (sic).</p>
                        <p>An examination of the citations  that adult care facilities are penalized with, <a href="http://bys.care/1DoNOgD" title="Arizona Department of Health Services" target="_blank">for example in Arizona</a>,  did show that Memory Care  units, overall, had many more citations than their assisted care counterparts.  The oversight is simply not as thorough, and  the residents are not believed. This is not surprising, though, as the well  documented and discussed "<a href="http://bys.care/1ySqHWg" title="Stanford Prison Experiment" target="_blank">Stanford Prison Experiment</a>" showed that large power  imbalances (locked-in) resulted in <a href="http://bys.care/16BQJp8" title="Wikipedia - Stanford prison experiment" target="_blank">increasingly bad behavior by those in  authority</a>.</p>
                        <h3><strong><em>Glimmers of Light</em></strong></h3>
                        <p>Probably the most hopeful  solution, to date, is the <a href="http://bys.care/1ENuQBL" title="CNN - 'Dementia village' inspires new care" target="_blank">Dementia Village in Holland</a>, where individuals with  dementia live relatively unencumbered lives under the distant oversight of  technology-aided caregivers. </p>
                        <p>Going forward, with the growing epidemic of  Alzheimer's, old solutions of warehousing people "for their own safety" will  need rethinking. Better ways to age-in-place, safely and with freedom, will  have to take the place of the wander/lock-up pattern that currently exists in  our Elder care system. </p>
