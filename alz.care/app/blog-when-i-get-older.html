                                <p>Disrupting the 100-year old nursing home industry is more challenging than disrupting
                                the taxi-cab monopolies taken on by <em>Uber</em>.</p>
                                <p>Notwithstanding the reported 44% rate of abuse in nursing homes, and the common pattern
                                 of introducing psychotropic medications to make the residents more pliant and docile, the
                                 industry is booming (so many aging baby boomers, after all).</p>
                                <p>But the <u>Dementia Friendly Community</u> is having success at doing exactly that – disrupting
                                 the nursing home industry. </p>
                                <h3>What is a Dementia Friendly Community?</h3>
                                <p>Broadly, the Dementia Friendly Community is <u><i><b>your</b></i></u> community, but where people with dementia are
                                 empowered to have high aspirations and feel confident, knowing they can contribute and participate
                                 in activities that are meaningful to them.</p>
                                <h3>More Details Please!</h3>
                                <p>Dementia friendly communities are springing up in England, Ireland, Singapore, Australia, and in states like
                                 Minnesota and Wisconsin...and they have these goals in common:
                                </p>
                                <p><img src="assets/images/blog/dementia-friendly-goal.jpg">
                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Involvement of people with dementia</li>
                                    <p>Shape communities around the needs and aspirations of people living with dementia alongside the views of
                                     their caregivers. Each community will have its own diverse populations and focus must include understanding
                                     demographic variation, the needs of people with dementia from seldom heard communities, and the impact of
                                     the geography, eg. rural versus urban locations.</p>
                                    <li>Challenge stigma and build understanding</li>
                                    <p>Work to break down the stigma of dementia, including in seldom heard communities, and increase awareness
                                    and understanding of dementia.</p>
                                    <li>Accessible community activities</li>
                                    <p>Offer organized activities that are specific and appropriate to the needs of people with dementia. Also
                                     ensure that existing leisure services and entertainment activities are more inclusive of people with dementia.</p>
                                    <li>Acknowledge potential</li>
                                    <p>Ensure that people with dementia themselves acknowledge the positive contribution they can make to their
                                    communities. Build on the goodwill in the general public to make communities dementia friendly.</p>
                                    <li>Ensure an early diagnosis</li>
                                    <p>Ensure access to early diagnosis and post-diagnostic support. Have health and social care services that
                                    are integrated and delivering person-centered care for people with dementia in all settings.</p>
                                    <li>Practical support to enable engagement in community life</li>
                                    <p>Deliver a befriending service that includes practical support to ensure people with dementia can engage
                                    in community life as well as offering emotional support.</p>
                                    <li>Community-based solutions</li>
                                    <p>Support people with dementia in whatever care setting they live, from maintaining independence in their
                                    own home to inclusive, high-quality care homes. Community based solutions to housing can prevent people
                                    from unnecessarily accessing healthcare and support people to live longer in their own homes.</p>
                                    <li>Consistent and reliable travel options</li>
                                    <p>Ensure that people with dementia can be confident that transport will be consistent, reliable and
                                    responsive and respectful to their needs.</p>
                                    <li>Easy-to-navigate environments</li>
                                    <p>Ensure that the physical environment is accessible and easy to navigate for people with dementia.</p>
                                    <li>Respectful and responsive businesses and services</li>
                                    <p>Promote awareness of dementia in all shops, businesses and services so all staff demonstrate
                                    understanding and know how to recognize symptoms. Encourage organizations to establish strategies
                                    that help people with dementia utilize their business.</p>
                                </ol>

                                <h3>Is this Dementia Friendly Community in Harmony with the Needs of People Living with Dementia?</h3>
                                <p>The broadly defined goals of the Dementia Friendly Community closely conform to needs of those living
                                with dementia. The National Dementia Declaration for England (Dementia Action Alliance, 2010) captured
                                seven outcomes, as described by people with dementia and caregivers, that are needed to live well with
                                the condition:
                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>I have personal choice and control or influence over decisions about me.</li>
                                    <li>I know that services are designed around me and my needs.</li>
                                    <li>I have support that helps me live my life.</li>
                                    <li>I have the knowledge and know-how to get what I need.</li>
                                    <li>I live in an enabling and supportive environment where I feel valued and understood.</li>
                                    <li>I have a sense of belonging and of being a valued part of family, community and civic life.</li>
                                    <li>I know there is research going on which delivers a better life for me now and hope for the future.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <br>
                                <h3>What’s the Economic Case for Dementia Friendly Communities?</h3>
                                <p>The Alzheimer’s Society of the UK, in its 2013 survey/report rolled up its sleeves to answer the question
                                about hard dollars and the dementia friendly community stating, a year living in the community with dementia
                                (excluding the initial memory services assessment) is estimated to cost £24,128. This includes the cost of
                                an integrated health and social care package, together with respite, therapies and medication.</p>
                                <blockquote class="custom-quote"><b><i>A year in residential care costs an average of £35,424. Therefore, for every person who is able
                                to live at home rather than in residential care there is a saving of £11,296 per year or £941 per month.
                                Therefore, if just 5% of admissions to residential care were to be delayed for one year as a result of
                                dementia-friendly communities, there would be a net saving of £55 million per annum across England, Wales and
                                Northern Ireland.</i></b></blockquote>
                                <br>
                                <h3>The Future</h3>
                                <p>What we know now is that that the financial and human costs of our warehousing approach to “looking after”
                                people with dementia are unsustainable, and morally suspect (see
                                <a href="http://majadaniels.com/projects/into-oblivion/" target="_blank">Maja Daniels’ photo essay</a> on a
                                “memory care” unit in Northern France).</p>
                                <p><em><b>Disruption is next.</b></em></p>
                                <p>In the next post, I will detail case studies of how communities around the globe are realizing the goals
                                set forth for the dementia friendly community.</p>
